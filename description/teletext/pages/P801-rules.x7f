 The aim of these rules is to keep      
 Twitch Plays Pokemon an enjoyable place
 for everyone. We rewrote them from the 
 previous rules to make them more like  
 guidelines than laws, and to make the  
 more technical parts easier to enforce.
                                        
 It should be assumed that moderators   
 will use their own discretion towards  
 the more subjective guidelines, but    
 (respectfully) user feedback is always 
 welcome.
