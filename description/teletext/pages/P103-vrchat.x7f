 Twitch Plays Pokemon has a VRChat      
 world where one can watch and play the 
 run.                                   
                                        
 There is a big controller that can be  
 used to press buttons.                 
                                        
 People in the VRChat world are visible 
 on-stream.Manual approval is needed   
for avatars to be visible.             
                                        
 No audio from the world is played      
 through to the stream.
