 * * * Since we know each match is a    
   match and they don't exist in a void,
   a mod will generally give a warning  
   before any timeout is issued and will
   generally wait at least 1 match after
   the warning before giving a timeout. 
   Exceptions may be made when deemed   
   necessary by mod discretion due to   
   severity or repetition.
