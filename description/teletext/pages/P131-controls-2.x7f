Only thefirst wordof your chat message
is checked to see if it's a button, you 
can add extra words to the end of your  
message and it will still be accepted.  
                                        
Two buttons can be pressed at the same  
time by using+in-between.B+RIGHTwill
pressBandRIGHTat the same time.     
                                        
The button can be held for longer by    
using-at the end. For example:UP-   
will holdUPfor longer than usual.     
Sequential held buttons will merge into 
a single long press if the rate is high.
                                        
Heavy inputters should be aware that    
Twitch will chat-ban you site-wide for  
up to an hour if you send more than 20  
messages in 30 seconds (non-subs only).
