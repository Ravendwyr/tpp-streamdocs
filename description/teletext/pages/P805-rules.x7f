 * Don't spam. Avoid flooding chat with 
   long, repetitive, or nonsensical     
   messages, as well as excessive use of
   emotes, caps lock, and special       
   Unicode characters. The bot will     
   automatically enforce this for the   
   most part, but manual timeouts can be
   issued as well.

   permission.
