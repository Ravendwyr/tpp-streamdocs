 * Use only one account at a time. If   
   you wish to switch accounts, you must
   wait one hour after sending a message
   on one account before you will be    
   allowed to use the other. (The bot   
   automatically enforces this for      
   registered alts.)                    
                                        
 * Only one account can receive rewards 
   (random pinball drops and PBR        
   leaderboard rewards) at a time. The  
   bot automatically handles this rule  
   for registered alts.
