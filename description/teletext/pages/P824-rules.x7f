 Bots that simply read chat without     
 sending messages, as well as bots that 
 only whisper commands which don't      
 affect runs or PBR (badge trading,     
 token storms, etc.) are allowed. Bots  
 that do send messages require approval 
 from mods/admins. Note that any bot    
 that sends inputs will not be approved.
 The only exception to this is          
 tppsimulator.
