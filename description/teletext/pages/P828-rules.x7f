 A PBR match will be manually canceled  
 and recorded as a draw if: (1/2) * The 
 game freezes or softlocks and is       
 unrecoverable * If a softlock occurs   
 and the match does not automatically   
 cancel, but the match is not one where 
 inputs affect the match (such as       
 Defiance or Metronome), then it will be
 replayed from the start instead.
