 * Respect other users, and the chat as 
   a whole.                             
                                        
 * * Don't bully, harass, gaslight or   
   slander users.                       
                                        
 * * Don't start fights or provoke      
   people. Even in situations where     
   there are arguments over different   
   objectives, or in cases where some   
   players are just inputting           
   suboptimally, all sides must remain  
   nice and respectful towards each     
   other.
