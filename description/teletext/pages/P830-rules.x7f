 If the match was not canceled before it
 ended, but falls into the cases above, 
 it will be retroactively reverted to a 
 draw (and balances will be adjusted    
 accordingly). If a match was canceled  
 and recorded as a draw, but it is clear
 that one side was going to win, and it 
 was impossible for them to lose with   
 any inputs if the match had played out,
 then the match will be retroactively   
 recorded as a win for that side (and   
 balances will be adjusted accordingly).
