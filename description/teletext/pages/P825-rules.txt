 Moderators will give timeouts as needed
 to enforce these guidelines and keep   
 TPP enjoyable. Timeout lengths are     
 generally scaled to severity and       
 persistence, but are completely        
 case-by-case; we make no guarantee of  
 consistency.                           
                                        
 While you are timed out you should not 
 have access to the bot via whispers,   
 but in case you do, don't abuse Mail or
 other items or we may extend your      
 timeout.
