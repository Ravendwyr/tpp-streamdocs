 TPP has a complicated past with how we 
 treat one person using multiple        
 accounts. It is difficult to           
 effectively enforce this, though. So   
 our current policy is we don't really  
 mind if you use a 2nd account ("alt"), 
 as long as it's in good faith. But we'd
 strongly prefer it if you told us      
 first.                                 
                                        
 * First and foremost, we reserve the   
   right to ban any obvious,            
   unregistered alt on sight, even if   
   it's not doing anything wrong.
