 * * Don't stop new gameplay for an     
   unreasonable amount of time.         
   Intentionally stopping us from       
   progressing, or at least doing       
   something new, for a long amount of  
   time will be punished if it's only   
   one person or a small number of      
   people doing it. Since every         
   situation is unique, mods will use   
   their discretion to determine        
   appropriate timings and punishments  
   for each case.
