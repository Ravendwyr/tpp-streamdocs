 * * Don't intentionally try to lose    
   money ("throw") so often that the    
   game is unfun and predictable. * *   
   Don't throw a specific person in     
   order to harass them. * * Don't throw
   in collusion with another player(s)  
   to get them higher on the            
   leaderboard. This is match fixing. * 
   * Don't draw out the length of a     
   match for no good reason.
