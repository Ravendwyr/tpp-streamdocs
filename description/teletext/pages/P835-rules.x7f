 Alts before registration and bots will 
 have their tokens, badges and items    
 redistributed to random chat members   
 ("liquidated") after they are          
 discovered. Users can also request to  
 have their accounts liquidated for any 
 reason. Note that user-requested       
 liquidations will not be performed on  
 demand and will in most cases be       
 deferred for a month or more to give   
 the user an opportunity to change their
 minds.
