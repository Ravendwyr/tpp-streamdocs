## How To Play

Chat the name of the button you want to see pressed in-game!

For GameBoy, the available buttons are **up**, **down**, **left**, **right**, **a**, **b**, **start** and **select**.

You can pick a side by typing **!left** for Gold or **!right** for Silver. If you don't want to pick, you'll be randomly assigned on your first input.

You can switch sides whenever you want.

## Tips
- Buttons are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, **StArT** will have the same effect as **start**.
- Only the first word of your chat message gets counted as a button. This means you can add a space and a message or emote after your button and the game will still see it.
- "Your message is identical to the one you sent within the last 30 seconds." can be evaded with the above tips.
- You can also use cardinal directions as a shorthand for regular directions: **up**, **right**, **down**, **left** become **n**, **e**, **s**, **w**.
- Heavy inputters should be aware that Twitch's automatic anti-spam system will disconnect you from Twitch chat site-wide for up to an hour if you send 20 or more messages in 30 seconds or less. Channel subscribers will still get disconnected, but can reconnect to their subscribed channels right away.
