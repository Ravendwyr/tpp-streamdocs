## TPP's 10th Anniversary Celebration

To celebrate 10 years of Twitch Playing Pokémon, we've donned our classic look and are playing a "Super Gauntlet" of games in which we intend to visit every mainline Pokémon region. After 10 years, we know these regions by heart. This time, we're playing without emulators. Each run will be played on official Nintendo hardware and displayed on a real CRT TV! Join us as we take a nostalgic look at the Pokémon series throughout the years, as well as experiment with hardware peripherals that some Pokémon games can use.

We continue Season 11 of TPP with our 88th run: **Super Gauntlet XD: Gale of Darkness**.

The stream clock time zone is set to UTC. You can use [this](https://time.is/UTC) to calculate your delay.

Looking for our more advanced stream features? Pinball, items, experience points, tokens, meme clips, Pokémon Badges, run emblems, and onstream notifications for donations and subscribers are currently disabled. They'll make a return after the event. Run Emblems and Badges for Pokémon caught during the event will be distributed after it is over.
