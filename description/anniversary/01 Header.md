## TPP's 10th Anniversary Celebration

To celebrate 10 years of Twitch Playing Pokémon, we've donned our classic look and are playing a "Super Gauntlet" of games in which we intend to visit every known Pokémon region. After 10 years, we know these regions like the back of our hand. This time, we're playing without emulators. Each run will be played on official Nintendo hardware and displayed on a real CRT TV! Join us as we take a nostalgic look at the Pokémon series throughout the years, as well as experiment with hardware peripherals that some Pokémon games can use.

We start off Season 11 of TPP with our 80th run: Super Gauntlet Red.

The stream clock time zone is set to UTC. You can use [this](https://time.is/UTC) to calculate your delay.
