If you co-stream Twitch Plays Pokemon during this event, your community can play directly from your channel's chat!

To set up, go live and then say **!join** in TPP Chat. Our bot will check to make sure your stream is online and then join your channel to process button inputs from it. Any inputs that come from your chat will have your stream icon displayed alongside.

When you go offline, the bot should detect this and leave your chat. If you want to trigger this manually, say **!leave** in TPP chat.

The TPP input bot will not attempt to moderate your channel or process any messages other than inputs.

Users cannot use this feature to circumvent timeouts or bans from the Twitch Plays Pokemon channel. The bot will simply refuse to process inputs from banned users. If Twitch Plays Pokemon chat is in Slow Mode, the bot will not accept inputs from any channel at a higher rate than TPP chat would allow.

*Note: This feature is experimental and may be disabled if it causes any issues.*
